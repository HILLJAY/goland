Today,I'm talking to the renowned botanist Jan Bosten,thank you for invited me to join you on the show Heny,
Recently,Jane,you become quite a celebrity,since the release of your latest documentary,
Can you tell us a little about it,
Well it flow my expedition to started the vegatation indigenous to the rain forest in equatorial area of the south Asia,
you certainly get to travel to some very exotic locations,
It was far from glamorous to be honest,The area we visited was accessible only by canoe and the living condition
in the hut were primitive to say the least,There is no electricity,Our water supply was a nearby stream,How was the
weather conditions while you were there,The weather was not conducive to our work at all since the humidity was almost unbearable
At midday we stay in the hut and did nothing,It was too humid to either work or sleep,
How long did you team spend in the jungle,Originally,we plan to be the for a month,But in the end we stayed for only 2 weeks
Why did you cut the expedition short?
Halfway with the trip we receive news that a hurricane was approaching,
And we have to evacuate on very short notice,
That's sounds like a fascinating anecdote,
It was frighting,
The fastest evacuation route was through river Rapids,
We have to navigate them carrying all of our equipment,
So overall was the journey unsuccessful?
Absolutely not,
We gathered a massive amount of data of the local planet life
Why do you put up this such adverse conditions?
Botan is an obsession for me,
Many of the destination i visited have a stunning scenery,
I get to meet a variety of people from all over the world,
So where will your next destination been?
I haven't decided yet
Then we can leave it for another vocation thanks
